GoEuroTest
==========

use this command to run the code. 
java -jar GoEuroTest.jar "STRING"


jar file for GoEuroTest is also present in the directory. 

For the api (https://api.goeuro.com/api/v1/suggest/position/en/name/STRING) I get the output on as follows:

{"results":[{"_type":"Position","geo_position":{"latitude":null,"longitude":null}},{"_type":"Position","geo_position":{"latitude":null,"longitude":null}}]}

Then after running the {java -jar GoEuroTest.jar "STRING"} command where "STRING" can be any string, a csv file(GoEuro.csv) is generated in the same folder where
GoEuroTest.jar is located. The content of the file is something as follows:
(Following is just a stub)

_type   longitude   latitude
Position    null    null
Position    null    null
